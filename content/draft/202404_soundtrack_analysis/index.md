## Dashboards (Tableau Public link [here]())



## Datasets

### IMDb Non-Commercial Datasets

For each TV show's genre and year of release, no dataset is more accessible than IMDb. Subsets of IMDb data are available for access to customers for personal and non-commercial use [here at this link](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/). The dataset files can be accessed and downloaded from https://datasets.imdbws.com/. The data is refreshed daily.

### Self-Curated Spotify Playlists of Songs From TV Shows I Watched Over the Years

I'm personally a Spotify playlist addict. I love to curate song playlists for different moods, vibes, and seasons, or I make playlists of tracks produced by my favorite artists. Sometimes when I heard great songs playing in TV shows, I would add it into my playlists. And then I developed a habit of making playlists for songs playing in the TV show that I watched. The analysis includes **28 playlists** curated mainly by me, a.k.a. **[RecmRoom](https://open.spotify.com/user/mn2y0ay9emuhncqd3yqdm2x76?si=3f66f5faf03344a5)** on Spotify. You're welcome to check each playlist on [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1csc2dKC11QIZzjmr3jke3FPXEclEBG82bH2e1kGWEbU/edit?usp=sharing). 

With [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/), you can find details of each song in the playlist including genre, mood, artist, date of release, and other musical attributes. If you want to avoid typing codes, there are several free online tools available, such as [Spotify Playlist Analyzer](https://www.chosic.com/spotify-playlist-analyzer/). By copying and pasting your playlist link in the search box and analyze, it would output all kinds of details and you could also export table as csv. 

## Inspirations

Thanks to [Emanuela Blaiotta](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emanuela8569)'s [A week in music - Spotify API](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emanuela8569/viz/Aweekinmusic-SpotifyAPI/Spotify), I get to know that it's even possible to embed Spotify in Tableau dashboard.
