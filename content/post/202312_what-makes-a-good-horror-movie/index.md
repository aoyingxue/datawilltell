## Project background

Tableau partners with IMDB and presents the "Data Plus Movies" challenge. The dataset provided by IMDB contains movies from 1900 to 2022. Challenge link is [here](https://www.tableau.com/community/movies). You're still welcome to play with it.

So last November, Halloween has just passed the corner, yet the allure of horror movies remains still.  I watched a lot of horror films and came to wonder that what the defining points are that make a good horror movie? I‚Äôve explored a bit from #DataPlusMovies data and did a quick research on horror movies over the years. 

## Challenges

It‚Äôs a quick design that only took me one day, so it‚Äôs not really statistically proven. It‚Äôs my first public project that I get to play a bit with. And I‚Äôm happy with the t-shirt I get afterwards from Tableau.
